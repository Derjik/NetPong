# NetPong - Network Pong implementation

**[Work in progress]**

Nothing to see here for the moment :/
This is a first network-game attempt.
As the title says: pong. Multiplayer. With network.
I'm using [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) for the client GUI and
[LibMach](https://github.com/Derjik/LibMach) for both the client & server
network stacks.
